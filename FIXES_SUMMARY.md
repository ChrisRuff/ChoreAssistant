# Chore Assistant Integration - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Removed Testing Code
- Deleted `test_chore_integration.py` and `test_integration.py` as requested
- No testing code remains in the integration

### 2. Fixed Sensor State Calculation
- **Issue**: Sensor state was only calculated once and wasn't updating properly
- **Fix**: Modified the `state` property in `sensor.py` to always recalculate the state based on current time
- **Improvement**: Enhanced time calculation to consider seconds, not just days, for more accurate state detection

### 3. Improved Entity ID Handling
- **Issue**: The `_extract_chore_name` function had limited entity ID format support
- **Fix**: Enhanced the function in `__init__.py` to handle multiple entity ID formats correctly
- **Improvement**: Better parsing of entity IDs for service calls

### 4. Enhanced Chore State Logic
- **Issue**: Chore states were not granular enough for adaptive chores
- **Fix**: Added `due_now` state for chores due within the next hour
- **Improvement**: More precise time-based state calculations

### 5. Service Configuration Improvements
- **Issue**: Inconsistent service parameter selectors
- **Fix**: Updated `services.yaml` to use entity selectors for remove, update, and complete services for better user experience
- **Improvement**: More consistent user experience across all services with proper entity selection in UI

### 6. Code Structure Fixes
- **Issue**: Incorrect indentation in `__init__.py`
- **Fix**: Corrected the indentation of the `_register_services` function

## Key Improvements

1. **Real-time State Updates**: Sensors now properly update their state based on current time
2. **Better Time Handling**: More precise time calculations for chore states
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent service interfaces with improved parameter handling
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed all testing code and fixed structural issues

## Files Modified

- `custom_components/chore_assistant/__init__.py` - Fixed entity ID handling and indentation
- `custom_components/chore_assistant/sensor.py` - Improved state calculation and time handling
- `custom_components/chore_assistant/services.yaml` - Updated service parameter selectors
- Removed test files: `test_chore_integration.py`, `test_integration.py`

The integration should now work more reliably with accurate state updates and better user experience.
