# Chore Assistant Integration - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Crash when adding chores** - FIXED
- **Problem**: The integration was crashing due to incomplete code in the `add_chore` service handler
- **Root Cause**: The file had truncated code with `..._data.get("last_completed")` which was incomplete
- **Fix**: Completed the `add_chore` service handler with proper error handling and validation

### 2. **File path issues** - FIXED
- **Problem**: The integration was trying to save to a non-existent directory
- **Fix**: Added `os.makedirs(chore_dir, exist_ok=True)` to ensure the directory exists

### 3. **Date handling issues** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Date objects weren't being properly serialized to strings
- **Fix**: Added proper date formatting using `.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")` for date objects

### 4. **Entity creation issues** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Sensors weren't being created properly for new chores
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling around entity creation with try-catch blocks

### 5. **Missing error handling** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Services would crash on invalid input or missing chores
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging for all service handlers

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Robust Error Handling**: All service handlers now have proper exception handling
2. **Input Validation**: Added checks for duplicate chore names and invalid data
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensured all dates are stored as strings in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. **Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging issues
5. **File Operations**: Added proper file handling with encoding and directory creation

## How to Use

### Adding a Chore via Home Assistant Service
```yaml
service: chore_assistant.add_chore
data:
  name: "Clean Kitchen"
  due_date: "2024-07-30"
  frequency: "weekly"
  description: "Clean all kitchen surfaces"
  assigned_to: "John"
  chore_type: "fixed"
  max_days: 3
  adaptive_window: 3
```

### Available Services
- `chore_assistant.add_chore` - Add a new chore
- `chore_assistant.remove_chore` - Remove an existing chore
- `chore_assistant.update_chore` - Update chore details
- `chore_assistant.complete_chore` - Mark chore as complete and update due date

### Chore Types
- **fixed**: Uses frequency-based scheduling (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **adaptive**: Adjusts next due date based on when you actually complete it

## Testing the Integration

1. **Restart Home Assistant** after applying these fixes
2. **Check logs** for any error messages
3. **Test adding a chore** using the Developer Tools > Services
4. **Verify sensors** are created in Developer Tools > States

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Chore already exists"**: Use a unique name for each chore
2. **"Invalid date format"**: Ensure due_date is in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **"Chore not found"**: Check the exact name spelling when updating/removing
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure Home Assistant has write access to the custom_components directory

## Next Steps

1. Restart Home Assistant
2. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations
3. Add the "Chore Assistant" integration
4. Use Developer Tools > Services to test adding a chore
